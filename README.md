# daily-affirmation-llm-app

This is a Shiny for Python app that generates a daily morning affirmation based on a theme and optional character persona like Dwight Schrute. It uses the OpenAI API to generate the affirmation text and Google Text-to-Speech API to convert the text to speech via the gtts library.

## Setup

The app expects that you have an OpenAI API key that you can paste into the input box. You can get one by visting the OpenAI API [quickstart page](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/).

## Accessing the app

You can clone this repo and run the app locally or access the app via [Connect Cloud](https://connect.posit.cloud/) at the website link in the repository details (under "About"). You may need to create a Connect Cloud account to access the app.
